# Strobe-Library
The Strobe Library is a simple library designed to control high powered led's in a unique way.
The actual project consists of two 10 watt led's that are connected to a mosfet.  The gate of the
mosfet is connected to pin 9 on the Arduino, and then the sketch has control over the led's.
